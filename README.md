Introduction: 
This Python program simulates a rolling dice game for 2 to 6 players. The game involves rolling a dice, accumulating scores, and determining the winner based on the highest score.

Key Concepts:
1. Random Number Generation: The program uses the random module to generate random dice values between 1 and 6.
2. Player Input Validation: It validates the number of players entered to ensure it is between 2 and 6.
3. Game Logic: The game progresses by allowing each player to roll the dice, accumulate scores, and determine the winner based on the highest score.# Rolling-dice-game-Using-Python
